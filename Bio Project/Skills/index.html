	<p>I have many skills. I can sing, play cello, dance, swim, program, math, and many other things.</p>
	<p>I like to sing, because you can sing almost any song. And you can sing, almost anywere.I am going to be in a musical theater camp, and the
	musical is Be More Chill.</p>
	<p>I have been dancing, for a year now, and I love it! My favorite dance, is Ballet, but this year I am going to do jazz. For the dance recital
	my dress was gold, and green. It was so fun!
