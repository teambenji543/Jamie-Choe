		<p> I have 4 people in my family. My younger brother, my mom, my dad, and me. My grandparents live really close to me. 
		They never use their pool, so my family use it alot! We go there almost every day. I live in a normal house. But it has a big backyard with
		a playground!</p>
		<p>Our playground, has a skatebored and, 2 swings! It even has a bumpy green slide. My dad made a shed in my backyard, and now it stores 
		all the tools.</p>
