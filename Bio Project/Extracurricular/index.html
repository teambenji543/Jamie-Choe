		<h2>Extracurricular</h2>
			<p>I do many things. I do cello. The cello can be fun, but I hate practicing. You can play many different songs. And I even play in my 
			School Strings.I also do Spanish. We do some fun stuff, like games, and other stuff. My Spanish teacher, also always comes really late to
			class, so it is not that bad. But my family went to Costa Rica, and Nicaragua, and they were SO hot! There was no air condishining. 
			which made it even more hot.I also do singing, it is fun, and you can practice almost anywear. I have been in the George Mason Hansel and Gretel opera, and it was
			really fun.I also do Ballet. It is fun but it can get tiring. It is also hard to balence when you are standing on one leg. </p>
