	<p>I have, 2 dogs, 1 Guinea pig, and 2 fish. My dogs names are, Benji, and Happy. Benji, has curly brown hair. Benji is very nice, but he
	does get nervous sometimes. Happy, is white and very mean. He bites eveybody, including me! He is also alittle fat. He barks at the table,
	and wakes my parents up very early in the morning.
	</p><p>My Guinea pig's name is Lily. Lily is black, white, and cream. She eats so much! I give her tons of hay, pellets, and veggies!
	She also squeaks alot. </p>
