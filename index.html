		<h1>All About Me</h1>
		
		<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Hi, name is Jamie Choe. I am a rising 6th grader at Stenwood Elementerary School. I have two dogs, fish, and one guinea pig. I like the color pink, 
			and I love animals. I like to code alot, I use Scratch the most, but I am getting into Python.
		</p>
		
		<h2>where I have Lived</h2>
		<p>
			I have lived in 4 different places, Chicago, Texas, Korea, and Virgina. Chicago is very cold, but I don't remember, because I was a baby.
			Texas on the other hand, is <u>VERY</u> hot! Korea was hard, because I did not know how to speak Korean. Virgina is good, because it is 
			cold in the winter, and hot in the summer.

		<h2 id=dogs> My Dogs</h2>
		<p>
			my dog's name's are, Benji, and Happy. <i>Benji</i> is a mini brown labradoodle. He is very enerjetic, but he get's nervous when we ever 
			take him out of the house. Happy is a white maltese. Happy is <b>really mean.</b> He bites everybody, and he never stoppes barking. After 
			awile it get's so anoying!

		<h2 id=Guinea>My Guinea Pig</h2>
		<p>
			My guinea pig's name is Lily. <U>Lilly eats alot!</U> I fill her cage with hay, every day, I give her a scoop of pettels, and 2 cups of 
			veggies, and she still eats it all! She is acually a pretty small guinea pig. She also poops every minute, so maby thats were all her 
			food goes. Lilly squeaks so loud for food, that it gets anoying!

		<h2 id=program>Programming</h2>
		<p>
			I love to code, especially on Scratch. I have made many games, but my most recent one is a virtual dog. I love how you don't have to 
			worry that much on mistakes, because the code is all writen out. I am starting to learn Python, but it is alot more harder than Scratch, 
			because you have to type all the code, and you have to worry about mistakes.

		<h2 id=game>Video Games</h2>
		<p>
			My favorite video game is Minecraft. In Minecraft you can make almost anything, and you have <b>tons</b> of different materials. I have 
			made a pink house before, with rainbow sheep on top.You can even join your friends and play with them.

			cried when she was reading a book! But Mrs.Shepherd loves us<u>alot!</u>
